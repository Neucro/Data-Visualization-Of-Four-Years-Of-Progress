# Data-Visualization-Of-Four-Years-Of-Progress
In this data analysis, I made a dataset by my own from some old result sheets of my friend's bachelor's result and tried to grab some data insights from it by using matplotlib and pandas with python. It's a prgoress sheet of consquent four years of marks during a program called "Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science". In X axes, I kept all the courses and on Y axes I kept all the grade points. For normalization, I convert the course names into number regarding their level. For instance, courses of first year are in the range of 0-10, second year 10-20, third year 20-30 and fourth year 30-40. The moving avatar I used here is to locate the most dropping points which indicate the lowest progress of the entire bachelor's program. On the other hand, the red circles I used to show the pick points of progress and the yellow circles are the areas where the student was fully focused on the studies and progress. I hope I will implement this concepts from this beginner level data visualization to something bigger someday soon. The grade points are here out of 4.00.
